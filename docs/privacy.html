            <h2>Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>StudyCoor is designed with privacy as a core principle. <strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.</strong></p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
            <p>All data entered into StudyCoor is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Study configurations and parameters</li>
                <li>Subject identifiers (codes/names you enter)</li>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>If you purchase a subscription to unlock Pro features, Apple processes the transaction through the App Store. We use Apple's StoreKit 2 framework to verify your subscription status.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>An anonymous transaction identifier from Apple</li>
                <li>Your subscription status (active/inactive)</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not share your data with any third parties</strong> because we do not have access to it.</p>
            <p>The only external service integrated into the App is <strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> for processing in-app purchases and subscription verification.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
