# Privacy Policy for StudyCoor

**Effective Date:** January 11, 2026
**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

## Introduction

StudyCoor ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our StudyCoor mobile application (the "App").

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

StudyCoor is designed with privacy as a core principle. **We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.**

Specifically, we do NOT collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Study participant data or medical information
- Device identifiers or analytics data
- Location data
- Usage statistics or behavioral data
- Any information that could identify you or your study participants

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

All data entered into StudyCoor is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This includes:
- Study configurations and parameters
- Subject identifiers (codes/names you enter)
- Calculation history and compliance records
- Drug and dosing information
- Application preferences and settings

**This data never leaves your device** unless you explicitly choose to export it using the built-in export features (CSV or PDF).

### In-App Purchases

If you purchase a subscription to unlock Pro features, Apple processes the transaction through the App Store. We use Apple's StoreKit 2 framework to verify your subscription status. Apple may collect payment information according to their privacy policy, but we do not have access to your payment details.

We only receive:
- An anonymous transaction identifier from Apple
- Your subscription status (active/inactive)
- Subscription expiration date

This information is cached locally on your device and is not transmitted to any server we operate.

## How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use, share, or sell your data in any way.

The data you enter into the App is used solely for:
- Performing compliance calculations
- Displaying your calculation history
- Managing your studies and subjects
- Generating export files when you request them

## Data Storage and Security

All data is stored locally on your device using:
- **Apple SwiftData** - A secure, encrypted database framework
- **iOS Keychain** (if applicable for sensitive settings)
- **UserDefaults** (for non-sensitive preferences like theme settings)

Your device's security (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID) protects access to the App and its data.

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

**We do not share your data with any third parties** because we do not have access to it.

The only external service integrated into the App is:
- **Apple StoreKit** - For processing in-app purchases and subscription verification

Apple's use of data is governed by their privacy policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

## Your Data Rights

### Access and Control
You have complete control over your data:
- **View:** All your data is accessible within the App
- **Export:** Use the export feature to save calculations as CSV or PDF
- **Delete:** Delete individual calculations or studies at any time
- **Erase All Data:** Uninstalling the App removes all local data permanently

### Data Portability
You can export your calculations in industry-standard formats (CSV, PDF) at any time.

### Data Deletion
To permanently delete all data:
1. Delete individual records within the App, or
2. Uninstall the App from your device

**Note:** Deleted data cannot be recovered. We do not maintain backups because we do not store your data on our servers.

## Children's Privacy

StudyCoor is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect information from children. The App is designed for use by clinical research professionals.

## Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance
While StudyCoor is designed for pharmaceutical study coordination, it is your responsibility to ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, or other applicable laws in your jurisdiction.

**Important:** Do not enter protected health information (PHI) into subject identifier fields. Use anonymous subject codes or study IDs to maintain participant privacy.

### Data Breach Notification
Because all data is stored locally on your device and we do not operate any servers or databases, there is no risk of a data breach from our systems. However, you are responsible for:
- Securing your device with a passcode
- Not sharing your device with unauthorized individuals
- Following your organization's data security policies

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the App and on our website (if applicable). The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will reflect the date of the most recent changes.

Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

## International Users

StudyCoor can be used worldwide. All data processing occurs locally on your device, regardless of your location.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or other regions with data protection laws, please note:
- **Legal Basis for Processing:** We process data locally on your device with your consent
- **Data Controller:** You are the data controller for any study data you enter
- **GDPR Rights:** You have the right to access, rectify, and delete your data at any time through the App

## Contact Us

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:

**Email:** [Your contact email]

## California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):
- Right to Know: We do not collect personal information
- Right to Delete: You can delete all data by uninstalling the App
- Right to Opt-Out: We do not sell personal information

Since we do not collect personal information, most CCPA provisions do not apply to our App.
